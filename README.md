# E-commerce Dataset SQL Analysis ðŸ›’

This project demonstrates SQL-style data analysis on the [Olist e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) using **Pandas** and **SQLite** in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files Included

- `olist_sql_analysis.ipynb` â€“ The main Jupyter Notebook containing SQL queries on the Olist dataset.
- CSV files â€“ Raw datasets from the Olist e-commerce data collection.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

The notebook walks through:

1. **Basic SQL Queries**  
   Using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` to explore data.

2. **Joins**  
   Examples of `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` to combine product and category data.

3. **Subqueries**  
   Used to find top-reviewed products.

4. **Aggregate Functions**  
   `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT` for generating business metrics.

5. **Views**  
   Created a reusable view (`product_revenue`) for analyzing top-selling products.

6. **Indexes**  
   Implemented indexing to optimize query performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- SQLite (via `sqlite3`)
- Jupyter Notebook
